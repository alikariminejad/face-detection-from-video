# face-detection-from-video
Detecting the face of a person in a video

This project has two parts: 1- You give it a picture of a person, it detects the face of the person and checks if the image is upside down or not and make a 180 degree rotation if it's upside down and shows the output image. 2- you give it a video to detect the face of the person that you give a picture of him/her and it shows a green rectangle around the person's face if the program detects that face.

you have to install dlib, cv2, numpy and face_recognition libraries and also add shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat to your directory.
